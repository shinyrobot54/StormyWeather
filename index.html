            <p>
                Life is bare, gloom and mis'ry everywhere.
                Stormy weather.
                Just can't get my poor self together.
                I'm weary all the time, so weary all the time.
            </p>

            <p>
                When he went away the blues walked in and met me.
                If he stays away old rockin' chair will get me.
